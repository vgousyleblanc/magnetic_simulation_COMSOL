# magnetic_simulation_COMSOL
Scripts used in order to launch the simulation of the PTF geometry and compensated as much as possible the magnetic field created. 

The location of the COMSOL file on the neuprime computer is : C:\Users\vgousyleblanc\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\mph\magnetic_field_compensation_geo_extended_2 .The size of the file is quite large but should contain all the geometrical important elements.
